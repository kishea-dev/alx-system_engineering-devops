**Post-Mortem: Deployment Disruption Incident**

**Background:**
On September 10, 2023, from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM (UTC), an incident occurred during the deployment of a new feature in our web application. This incident affected user access and led to a temporary disruption in service. Although only a small subset of users was impacted, the incident highlighted the importance of careful deployment procedures.

**Timeline:**
- September 10, 2:00 PM (UTC): Deployment of the new feature commenced as part of the regular release cycle.
- September 10, 2:15 PM (UTC): Monitoring alerts triggered due to increased error rates and slower response times.
- September 10, 2:20 PM (UTC): Initial investigation pointed toward database connection errors.
- September 10, 2:30 PM (UTC): The database team reviewed connection logs and identified unusual patterns.
- September 10, 2:45 PM (UTC): The incident was escalated to the deployment team for joint analysis.
- September 10, 3:00 PM (UTC): Database queries associated with the new feature were identified as a potential cause.
- September 10, 3:15 PM (UTC): Temporary rollback of the feature was executed to restore service stability.
- September 10, 3:30 PM (UTC): Service fully restored and incident concluded.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of the incident was traced back to inefficient database queries introduced with the new feature. These queries caused an unexpected spike in database connection usage and response times, leading to degradation in service quality.

**Remediation:**
To address the issue and prevent future occurrences, the following steps were taken:
- Query optimization: The database team worked with the development team to optimize the new feature's database queries.
- Thorough testing: Implementation of comprehensive testing procedures for new features before deployment.
- Improved monitoring: Enhancement of monitoring and alerting systems to identify abnormal database behavior.

**Lessons Learned:**
1. **Database Impact Assessment:** Conduct a thorough assessment of database queries and connections when introducing new features.
2. **Collaborative Response:** Establish streamlined communication channels between development and operations teams during incidents.
3. **Preventive Testing:** Rigorous testing in staging environments to catch potential performance issues before production deployment.
4. **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Monitor system behavior closely after deployment to quickly detect and address anomalies.
5. **Documentation Updates:** Maintain up-to-date documentation detailing new feature implementations, including their database interactions.

**Conclusion:**
The incident highlighted the importance of continuous vigilance in software deployments. As a student software engineer, I deeply appreciate the collaborative efforts of the team to swiftly respond and mitigate the disruption. Through this experience, I've gained insights into the significance of thorough testing, cross-functional communication, and the critical role of monitoring in maintaining reliable services. Regularly conducting post-mortems contributes to a culture of learning and improvement, ultimately leading to more robust and dependable software systems.
